<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Victor</h1>
<h3 align="center">I have worked for twelve years in a multinational as a programmer of PLCs and industrial robots. During this time I have worked hand in hand with the IT department in different projects, seeing how they managed their applications and databases to connect with the programmable controllers. I began to be interested in these applications, to wonder how they worked and how they interfered in my field. It caught my attention more and more until one day I decided to start preparing myself in that field and I began to study the Multiplatform Application Development cycle. Such has been my enthusiasm for this sector that I decided to leave the multinational, get out of my comfort zone to face a new challenge and bet on my new professional career as a software developer. I enjoy working as a team and being able to learn from the rest of my colleagues as well as transmitting my knowledge wherever possible.</h3>
